Simple Capture/Compare Timer

SCCT is a Simple Capture/Compare Timer written in Verilog. It provides
multiple capture/compare channels that use a common counter. Events
occurring in the single channels thus can be related to a global time base.
SCCT is developed as an IP core that can be attached to the Altera Avalon bus.
